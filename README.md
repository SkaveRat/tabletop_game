# Name: TODO

This is the repo for a future tabletop game. Name TBD


# Rule ideas / Plans

## Licence
Create Commons, or now. Later possibly ORC (once it is finalized)

## Basics
- Dice: Either d20, or d100 (2d10). The latter would have the possibility for more granularity
- Size scope: Playing field ~1sqm. Idea is to be able to play on a livingroom table
- Character size: 4-5cm height


## Characters

- Players should be able to create their own characters. Equipment and character abilities are given by the rulebook.
- Characters will collect XP by playing. These XP can be used to upgrade the character or equipment. And at the same time counts as buy-in points in a match.

### Factions, Classes & Races
- Ideas: Factions of "hackers", "the letter agencies"etc. Classes TBD. Races TBD
